      <p style="margin-right: 50px;"> A pharmacy management system developed using HTML can provide several benefits to pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and other staff members. Here are some of the key ways a pharmacy management system can be used:

        Inventory Management: A pharmacy management system can help pharmacy staff keep track of their inventory levels. The system can automatically update inventory levels as products are sold or restocked, reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts. This can help ensure that the pharmacy always has the medications and products needed to serve their patients.
        
        Prescription Processing: A pharmacy management system can help automate the prescription processing workflow. Staff can enter prescription details, including patient information, medication details, and insurance information, into the system. The system can then generate labels and track the prescription through the dispensing process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
        
        Patient Data Management: A pharmacy management system can help pharmacists and other staff members manage patient data, including medication history and allergy information. This can help ensure that patients receive the appropriate medications and reduce the risk of adverse reactions.
        
        Sales Tracking: A pharmacy management system can help track sales and revenue, providing valuable insights into the pharmacy's financial performance. This can help pharmacy owners make informed decisions about pricing, promotions, and inventory management.
        
        Reporting: A pharmacy management system can generate reports on various aspects of the pharmacy's operations, including inventory levels, sales data, and prescription processing. These reports can help pharmacists and other staff members identify trends and opportunities for improvement.
        
        Overall, a pharmacy management system developed using HTML can help pharmacies operate more efficiently, reduce errors, and provide better patient care.</p>

        Functionality: Include features that make it easy for tourists to plan their trips, such as booking tools, maps, and reviews.
        
        Mobile responsiveness: Ensure your website is mobile-friendly, as many tourists use their smartphones to plan and book their trips. </p>
